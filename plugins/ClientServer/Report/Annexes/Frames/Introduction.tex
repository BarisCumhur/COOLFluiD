\chapter{Introduction}

The frames used to exchange information between the server and the client are
all written in XML. They all contain the same root tag
(\texttt{ClientServerXML} tag) to ensure that a frame is a part of this
protocol. The root has exactly one child, the type tag, whose name gives the
type of the frame. This type tag may have children or not depending on the type
of the frame.\\

There are four frames structures : 

\begin{itemize}
 \item Some type tags need arguments. All arguments are mandatory. If
an argument is missing, the frame is not valid.
 \item Some type tags need XML data, appended as children of the type tag. Data
format depends on the type tag.
 \item Some type tags need arguments and data.
 \item Some type tags need neither arguments nor data.
\end{itemize}
