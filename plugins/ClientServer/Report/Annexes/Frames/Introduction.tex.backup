\chapter{Introduction}

The frames used to exchange information between the server and the client are
all written in XML. They all contain the same root tag
(\texttt{ClientServerXML} tag) to ensure that a frame is a part of this
protocol.\\

The root has exactly one child, the \textit{type tag}, whose name gives the
types of the frame. The tag may have children or not depending on the type of
the frame.\\

There are three types of structures : 

\begin{itemize}
 \item Some \textit{type tags} need arguments. All arguments are mandatory. If
an argument is missing, the frame is not valid.
 \item
 \item Some \textit{type tags} do not need any 
\end{itemize}
