The work presented if this report was performed on a stage at the Von Karman
Institute (VKI) in Rhode-St-Gen\`{e}se, Belgium. The aim was to develop a
graphical configuration tool for a simulation environment. This tool is composed
of an application, communicating over the network with the simulation software.
The first application is a client graphical interface, the second one is a
server that handles the requests and forwards them to the simulator. The
simulator is developed by the VKI employees and handles the simulation.\\

This report is composed of five volumes:

\begin{itemize}
 \item This volume discribes the problems I encountered and how I solved them;
 \item The first annex is a detailed description of the network
communication between both applications;
 \item The second annex is the reference manual of my code (the documentation);
 \item The third annex is the source code of my project and a code maintenance
manual;
\end{itemize}
